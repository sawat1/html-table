                 <h2>HTML:5</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>HTML5</strong>  is the latest evolution of the standard that defines <strong>HTML5</strong>
                     <i>The term represents two different concepts. It is a
                    new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that
                    allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 &amp;
                    friends and often shortened to just HTML5.</i>
                     </p><h2>CSS:3</h2>
            <p>CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of
            long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts
            like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts. Experimental parts are vendor-prefixed and should either be avoided
            in production environments, or used with extreme caution as both their syntax and semantics can change in the future.
